    <h1>DevOps</h1>
    <p>DevOps is not a tool or a team, it is the process or a methodology of using various tools to solve the problems between Developers and Operations team, hence the term “Dev-Ops”. The development team always had the pressure of completing the old, pending work that was considered faulty by the operations team. With DevOps, there is no wait time to deploy the code and getting it tested. Hence, the developer gets instantaneous feedback on the code, and therefore can close the bugs, and can make the code production ready faster! </p>
